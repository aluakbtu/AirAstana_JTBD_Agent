# JTBD Summary — Air Astana Procurement

## Job To Be Done (JTBD)
When managing complex procurement contracts across Legal, Finance, and Operations,
I want to identify risks, dependencies, and approval blockers early and transparently,
so I can complete procurements on time without introducing safety, compliance, or career risk.

## Core Pain Points
1) Manual contract review across disconnected documents (PDF, Word, email)
2) Sequential approvals driven by tool limitations and compliance fears
3) Lack of visibility and ownership across the end-to-end workflow
4) Fear of introducing unknown risk by changing legacy processes

## Root Cause
Procurement is treated as a cost-center support function within a safety-first culture, where slow, manual processes are perceived as safer than improving workflows that introduce organizational and cultural change.

## Desired Outcomes / Success Metrics
- Reduced procurement cycle time
- Fewer contract revision loops
- Early identification of risky clauses
- Transparent approval status and ownership
- Zero increase in compliance or safety incidents
