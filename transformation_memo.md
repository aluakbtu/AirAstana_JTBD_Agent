**TO:** Board of Directors, Air Astana Group
**FROM:** External Product Transformation Auditor
**DATE:** 2026-02-02
**SUBJECT:** Diagnostic of Product Operating Model Maturity

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
The Air Astana Group demonstrates the characteristics of a "Digital Immigrant" organization. While it exhibits strong operational excellence, financial discipline, and a clear intent towards "digitalisation" and "enhancing customer experience," its operating model remains largely rooted in traditional project-based management and an output-focused approach, with nascent but significant signals of emerging product thinking.

**2. EVIDENCE OF "FEATURE FACTORY" BEHAVIOR (RISKS)**
The current report contains several indicators of a "Feature Factory" mindset, where the focus is on delivering pre-defined features (outputs) rather than discovering solutions to customer problems (outcomes). This approach risks building the wrong things and failing to achieve true market impact.

1.  **Output-centric description of digital advancements:** The report frequently highlights specific features or system launches as achievements: "Continue enhancing award-winning customer experience with **upgraded website, new app, improved loyalty programme**" (Page 5). Similarly, "The most notable improvement in 2024 was the **launch of the upgraded website**, providing a more intuitive experience for customers... This will be followed by the **launch of the new app** in the first half of 2025" (Page 90).
    *   **Risk (Cagan):** This language indicates a focus on shipping features (outputs) rather than validating if these features effectively solve customer problems and drive measurable business outcomes. Without a clear problem-to-outcome linkage, these initiatives can become costly deliverables with unproven value.
2.  **Technology viewed as an implementation arm:** "Diyas Assanov brings extensive experience... particularly our **ongoing digitalisation**" (Page 12). The "Chief Digital and Information Officer" is noted for "leading large-scale digital transformation programmes, driving core modernisation of IT infrastructure and cloud migration" (Page 58).
    *   **Risk (Cagan):** Framing "digitalisation" primarily as an implementation or infrastructure modernization effort, rather than a continuous discovery and delivery process led by empowered product teams, positions technology as a cost center or support function, limiting its potential as a strategic innovation driver.
3.  **Project-based delivery mindset:** Initiatives like "The **implementation of Jeppesen Pairing Optimiser** is currently in progress and **expected to go live in April 2025**, which could bring potential savings of 5-7%" (Page 88).
    *   **Risk (Cagan):** A focus on "go live" dates for specific projects, even with clear financial benefits, typically signifies a project-based funding model. This approach often uses temporary teams and fixed scopes, stifling continuous iteration, learning, and the ability of teams to optimize for sustained outcomes.

**3. STRATEGIC DISCONNECTS**
The Group expresses a desire for "innovation" (Page 90) and has "embarked on a holistic **product-development journey**" (Page 22), suggesting an aspiration to evolve. However, the financial allocation and operational focus detailed in the report primarily support "maintenance" and expansion of existing physical assets and operational capabilities. Investments are heavily concentrated on fleet expansion, in-house maintenance facilities, and training centers (e.g., "Invest in more fuel-efficient and modern aircraft," "expansion of in-house fleet maintenance and training facilities" – Page 4, and "Advanced Technical Centre," "New hangars in Almaty and Astana," "Flight Training Centre" – Page 88). While crucial for an airline, this indicates a strategic disconnect where significant capital is directed towards sustaining the existing operational model, while the "product-development journey" and "digitalisation" efforts, although mentioned, do not appear to be backed by a clear, distinct organizational or financial shift to empower truly innovative, outcome-driven product teams at scale.

**4. THE PRESCRIPTION**
To mature into a true Product organization and fully capitalize on its "product-development journey," Air Astana Group must strategically shift its operating model in the following ways:

*   **Shift to Outcome-Driven Teams:** Transition from measuring success by features delivered (outputs) to measurable business and customer outcomes (e.g., higher NPS/CSAT linked to loyalty and repeat purchases, increased ancillary revenue per user, reduced friction points in the customer journey). Empower cross-functional product teams to discover and deliver solutions that achieve these outcomes, rather than simply executing a roadmap of pre-defined requirements.
*   **Implement Continuous Product Funding:** Replace traditional, annual, project-based budgeting cycles with continuous funding for persistent, empowered product teams. These teams should be aligned to long-term customer problems or value streams, allowing them the autonomy and resources for continuous discovery and iterative delivery, adapting their solutions based on validated learning and market feedback.
*   **Integrate Technology as a Core Product Capability:** Elevate the "Product" function by deeply integrating technology and business expertise within truly empowered product teams. The "Chief Digital and Information Officer" role should evolve to champion this integrated product vision, where technology is seen not just as an implementation or cost center, but as a core capability for discovering and delivering differentiated value to customers.
