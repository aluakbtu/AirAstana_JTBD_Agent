# Managerial Defense — Go / No-Go Decision
Project: AI Procurement Risk & Workflow Assistant  
Company: Air Astana Group

## 1. Executive Recommendation
**Decision: GO (with constraints)**

Proceed with a controlled pilot of the AI Procurement Assistant within a limited scope (selected contract types and departments), subject to strict governance and human-in-the-loop controls.

---

## 2. Business Rationale
The current procurement process suffers from long cycle times, manual reconciliation, approval bottlenecks, and elevated risk of missing critical contractual clauses. These inefficiencies create hidden costs through delays, stress, and risk exposure. The proposed AI agent directly addresses these issues without replacing human decision-makers.

## 3. ROI Estimate (Illustrative)
**Assumptions:**
- 1 Procurement Officer saves ~8 hours per week
- 20 Procurement Officers in scope
- Average fully-loaded hourly cost: $30
- Working weeks per year: 52

**Annual Time Savings:**
8 × 20 × 52 = **8,320 hours**

**Estimated Annual Value:**
8,320 × $30 ≈ **$249,600**

**Additional Non-Quantified Benefits:**
- Reduced risk of contractual penalties
- Fewer last-minute escalations
- Lower employee burnout and turnover risk

## 4. Key Risks
| Risk | Description |
|---|---|
| Compliance Risk | AI-generated insights could be misinterpreted as decisions |
| Data Sensitivity | Contracts contain confidential and sensitive data |
| Cultural Resistance | Safety-first culture may resist workflow change |
| Model Errors | False positives or missed clauses |

---

## 5. Risk Mitigation
- Human-in-the-loop: AI provides recommendations only
- Mandatory citation of source clauses for every flag
- Deployment within secure internal infrastructure
- Limited pilot scope with continuous monitoring
- Clear communication that AI augments—not replaces—Legal and Finance

---

## 6. Governance & Controls
- Role-based access aligned with existing policies
- Full audit trail of document versions and AI outputs
- Logging of all interactions for compliance review
- No autonomous approvals or external data sharing

---

## 7. Go / No-Go Criteria
**GO if:**
- Pilot reduces cycle time without compliance incidents
- Legal and Finance confirm trust in auditability
- Users adopt the tool without shadow processes

**NO-GO if:**
- Compliance risk increases
- AI outputs cannot be reliably explained or traced
- User adoption remains low after pilot

---

## 8. Conclusion
A controlled, well-governed pilot of the AI Procurement Assistant offers a favorable risk–reward profile. With strict safeguards and executive sponsorship, the solution can improve efficiency while preserving Air Astana’s safety and compliance standards.
